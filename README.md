# Branch and Bound Search
This code solves the Eight puzzle game using Branch and Bound Search. The Eight Puzzle is a game in which there are eight 1x1 tiles arranged on a 3x3 square so that there is one 1x1 uncovered (empty) area on the square. The tiles are labeled 1 through 8, and initially they are arranged in some random order. The idea is to reach the goal state (which has the central square empty, as shown below) from a given initial state by moving tiles one at a time.
